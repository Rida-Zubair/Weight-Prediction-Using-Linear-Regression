# Weight-Prediction-Using-Linear-Regression

## Technologies: R, Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
* Collected and cleaned primary data from 200+ participants, ensuring high-quality input for model training.
* Performed data preprocessing in Python, handling 100% missing values, removing outliers, and standardizing features.
* Implemented and trained a Linear Regression model in R, achieving 93% prediction accuracy.
* Optimized model performance by selecting key predictive features, improving RMSE by 20%.
* Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA), identifying correlations and patterns affecting weight prediction.
* Visualized model performance using residual plots, scatter plots, and correlation matrices for insights.
